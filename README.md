# First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) Algorithm Implementation for Operating Systems

This project implements the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm commonly used in operating systems for process scheduling. The project includes a simple web-based interface for entering process arrival times and burst times and displaying calculated results(start time,end time, waiting time, turn around time).

## Features

- Add processes with arrival times and burst times.
- Calculate and display start times, end times, waiting times, and turnaround times.
- Simple web-based interface for easy interaction.
